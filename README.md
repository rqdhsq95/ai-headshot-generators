## FAQ

**How long does AI headshot generation typically take compared to traditional photography?**

AI headshot generators create finished photos in 15 minutes to 2 hours depending on the platform, versus traditional photography requiring days or weeks for scheduling, shooting, and editing. You upload selfies immediately when ready rather than coordinating calendars with photographers, then receive dozens or hundreds of variations instead of hoping for one good shot. The speed advantage matters most for urgent needs like last-minute job applications or sudden speaking engagements where traditional photography timelines don't work.

**Do AI-generated headshots actually look realistic enough for professional use?**

Modern AI headshot generators like HeadshotPro, BetterPic, and InstaHeadshots produce photorealistic images indistinguishable from traditional photography when examined casually. Users report colleagues, friends, and family refusing to believe their headshots are AI-generated. The best platforms maintain natural skin texture, accurate facial proportions, and realistic lighting that avoid the overly smooth or artificial appearance of earlier AI tools. However, quality varies—expect 5-20 excellent headshots from each batch with the remainder showing minor flaws or inaccuracies.

**What makes AI headshots cost so much less than traditional photography?**

AI headshot generators eliminate studio rental, professional lighting equipment, photographer fees, makeup artists, travel time, and lengthy editing processes that drive traditional photography costs to $200-500 per session. Platforms charge $25-60 for dozens or hundreds of images by automating the entire production pipeline—the AI handles lighting optimization, background selection, outfit rendering, and photo enhancement instantly. You're essentially renting computational power instead of physical space and human expertise, dropping costs by 80-90% while maintaining professional quality suitable for LinkedIn, resumes, and business websites.
